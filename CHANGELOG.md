# CHANGELOG

## accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-plus

### Version 18.05

- This is the first version after splitting from the former common base repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce]
- Resources for base Ubuntu/VNC images and images with configurable Firefox split into separate GitHub repositories, consequently
  - README, CHANGELOG and Wiki are not common any more
  - Resources for base images moved to repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce]
  - Resources for images with default Firefox installation moved to repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox]
  - This image contains Firefox installation with pre-configuration support
